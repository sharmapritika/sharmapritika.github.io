**Authors:** Bharat Sharma and Benjamin Buettner <br>
**Abstract:** The usage of the word resilience in the last decade has tremendously increased in several fields, including the field of urban planning. Generally understood as “capacity to absorb and bounce back”; resilience aims to prepare a person or a city for uncertainties, shocks, and stresses.
The development of urban structure varies across the world. Recently increased awareness regarding environmental and air quality has attested the advantages of Transit Oriented Development over Transit Adjacent or Automobile-Oriented devel- opment.
In this thesis, an attempt to analyze the response of cities with different land use structure when stuck with warning based disaster has been made. Therefore, same transport infrastructure and supply has been modeled so as to generate results close to the reality. Different parameters - for instance, evacuation time, queue lengths, vehicle travel time, average delay time, and average speed - were analyzed for both cities.
The quantitative analysis using VISSIM 7 software confirmed the hypothesis that “transit oriented developments if faced with a shock, perform better than car de- pendent city structure.”

## Characteristics of Soil, Sand, Fly ash, and Ceramix Mix for Use as Subgrade Material

**Authors:** Bharat Sharma, Abhishek Sharma, Tushar Khandelwal, Neelmani Singh, Ashish Parmar, and R. K. Sharma <br>
**Abstract:** The most concerning problem today with the Thermal power plant is the disposal of Fly ash. The use of Fly ash as landfill causes great environmental pollution like, groundwater contamination, since coal contains trace levels of heavy metals. Similarly, waste ceramic too causes great environmental problem. So, there is a need to utilize these materials by exploiting their inherent properties to solve the environment and disposable problem. This report brings out the results of an experimental programme carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of using Fly ash with randomly distributed discrete waste ceramic for soil stabilization by studying the compaction and strength characteristics for use as subgrade material. The influence of different mix proportions of Clay, Sand, Fly ash and Ceramic on compaction, drainage and CBR values has been studied. The results show that addition of Fly ash increases the OMC and decreases the MDD, but increased the CBR. The designed composite may be used effectively for construction of subgrade, embankment and foundations of low cost roads.<br>

## Comparitive Analysis of Commercially Available Software Tools for Slope Stability and Simulation of Dynamic Loading

**Authors:** Bharat Sharma, Abhishek Sharma, Rounak Maheswari, Tushar Khandelwal, and R. K. Sharma <br>
**Abstract:** Analysis of slope stability is carried out to identify the most critical failure plane so as to minimize the occurrence of slope failures and landslides. It is always needed to give serious consideration before any construction or development is executed to ensure that the designed slopes remain stable. Slope failure can be determined through appropriate measurement of slope stability. In this study C-programming and GEO4 and Plaxis 2D software have been used to determine the factor of safety of the selected slope. Total station surveying has been used to prepare contour maps of the study area using LISCAD. The parameters such as soil cohesion (c), angle of internal friction (φ), and unit weight of soil (γ) have been determined using laboratory experiments. The site is modeled as multilayer so as to simulate real conditions as close as possible. The simulation involving dynamic loading as the site is subjected to mild earthquakes is also incorporated. The study is conducted for a site where the mode of failure is analyzed using Bishop’s method and appropriate preventive measure for slope stability is recommended and detailed design is provided.<br>

**Authors:** Thomas Vandal, Daniel McDuff, Weile Wang, Kate Duffy, Andrew Michaelis, and Rama Nemani <br>
**Abstract:** Earth-observing satellites carrying multispectral sensors are widely used to monitor the physical and biological states of the atmosphere, land, and oceans. These satellites have different vantage points above the Earth and different spectral imaging bands resulting in inconsistent imagery from one to another. This presents challenges in building downstream applications. What if we could generate synthetic bands for existing satellites from the union of all domains? We tackle the problem of generating synthetic spectral imagery for multispectral sensors as an unsupervised image-to-image translation problem modeled with a variational autoencoder (VAE) and generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture. Our approach introduces a novel shared spectral reconstruction loss to constrain the high-dimensional feature space of multispectral images. Simulated experiments performed by dropping one or more spectral bands show that cross-domain reconstruction outperforms measurements obtained from a second vantage point. Our proposed approach enables the synchronization of multispectral data and provides a basis for more homogeneous remote sensing datasets. <br>

**Authors:** Thomas Vandal & Rama Nemani <br>
**Abstract:** Applications of satellite data in areas such as weather tracking and modeling, ecosystem monitoring, wildfire detection, and landcover change are heavily dependent on the trade-offs related to the spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions of the observations. For instance, geostationary weather tracking satellites are designed to take hemispherical snapshots many times throughout the day but sensor hardware limits data collection. In this work we tackle this limitation by developing a method for temporal upsampling of multi-spectral satellite imagery using optical flow video interpolation deep convolutional neural networks. The presented model, extends Super SloMo (SSM) from single optical flow estimates to multichannel where flows are computed per wavelength band. We apply this technique on up to 8 multispectral bands of GOES-R/Advanced Baseline Imager mesoscale dataset to temporally enhance full disk hemispheric snapshots from 15 minutes to 1 minute. Through extensive experimentation with a multi-terabyte dataset, we show SSM greatly outperforms the linear interpolation baseline and that multichannel optical flows improves performance on GOES/ABI. Furthermore, we discuss challenges and open questions related to temporal interpolation of multispectral geostationary satellite imagery. <br>

## Quantifying Uncertainty in Discrete-Continuous and Skewed Data with Bayesian Deep Learning 

![alt text](assets/images/kdd2018-uq-intervals.png "Logo Title Text 1")

**KDD 2018 - Research Track** <br>
**Authors:** Thomas Vandal, Evan Kodra, Sangram Ganguly, Jennifer Dy, Rama Nemani, & Auroop Ganguly <br>
**Abstract:** Deep Learning (DL) methods have been transforming computer vision with innovative adaptations to other domains including climate change. For DL to pervade Science and Engineering (S&EE) applications where risk management is a core component, well-characterized uncertainty estimates must accompany predictions. However, S&E observations and model-simulations often follow heavily skewed distributions and are not well modeled with DL approaches, since they usually optimize a Gaussian, or Euclidean, likelihood loss. Recent developments in Bayesian Deep Learning (BDL), which attempts to capture uncertainties from noisy observations, aleatoric, and from unknown model parameters, epistemic, provide us a foundation. Here we present a discrete-continuous BDL model with Gaussian and lognormal likelihoods for uncertainty quantification (UQ). We demonstrate the approach by developing UQ estimates on “DeepSD’‘, a super-resolution based DL model for Statistical Downscaling (SD) in climate applied to precipitation, which follows an extremely skewed distribution. We find that the discrete-continuous models outperform a basic Gaussian distribution in terms of predictive accuracy and uncertainty calibration. Furthermore, we find that the lognormal distribution, which can handle skewed distributions, produces quality uncertainty estimates at the extremes. Such results may be important across S&E, as well as other domains such as finance and economics, where extremes are often of significant interest. Furthermore, to our knowledge, this is the first UQ model in SD where both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties are characterized. <br>

**Authors:** Thomas Vandal, Evan Kodra, Sangram Ganguly, Andy Michaelis, Rama Nemani, and Auroop Ganguly <br>
**Abstract:** The impacts of climate change are felt by most critical systems, such as infrastructure, ecological systems, and power-plants. However, contemporary Earth System Models (ESM) are run at spatial resolutions too coarse for assessing effects this localized. Local scale projections can be obtained using statistical downscaling, a technique which uses historical climate observations to learn a low-resolution to high-resolution mapping. Depending on statistical modeling choices, downscaled projections have been shown to vary significantly terms of accuracy and reliability. The spatio-temporal nature of the climate system motivates the adaptation of super-resolution image processing techniques to statistical downscaling. In our work, we present DeepSD, a generalized stacked super resolution convolutional neural network (SRCNN) framework for statistical downscaling of climate variables. DeepSD augments SRCNN with multi-scale input channels to maximize predictability in statistical downscaling. We provide a comparison with Bias Correction Spatial Disaggregation as well as three Automated-Statistical Downscaling approaches in downscaling daily precipitation from 1 degree (~100km) to 1/8 degrees (~12.5km) over the Continental United States. Furthermore, a framework using the NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) platform is discussed for downscaling more than 20 ESM models with multiple emission scenarios.<br>
